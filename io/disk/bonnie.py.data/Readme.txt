Bonnie++ is a disk and file system benchmarking tool for measuring I/O performance. With Bonnie++ you can quickly and easily produce a meaningful value to represent your current file system performance.
Example : ./bonnie++ -u root -d /mnt -s0 -b -n 10:100:10:1000

so one has to pass following parameter in the yaml file

disk: disk name on which test will run, sdx or mpatha or by-id scsi-xxxx etc
dir: /mnt (disk mounted on some dir. say /mnt here)
uid-to-use: root (user name or it UUID, here it is name i,e root)
number-to-stat: 10:0:0:2:8192 (Number of files to create file test)
size_to_pass: 0 (dataset size, here we are passing 0 to skip it as we running file related test)

# Bonnie options:
# bonnie++ [-d scratch-dir] [-c concurrency] [-s size(MiB)[:chunk-size(b)]]
#       [-n number-to-stat[:max-size[:min-size][:num-directories[:chunk-size]]]]
#       [-m machine-name] [-r ram-size-in-MiB]
#       [-x number-of-tests] [-u uid-to-use:gid-to-use] [-g gid-to-use]
#       [-q] [-f] [-b] [-p processes | -y] [-z seed | -Z random-file]
#       [-D]

# Valid options in avocado test are below:

example : 
uid-to-use: root
number-to-stat: 10:100:10:1000
data_size_to_pass: 0
