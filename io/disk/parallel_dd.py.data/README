The disk for which performance of read write operation over a file system has to be measured should be specified in yaml file.
The disk can either be physical disk like /dev/sda or device by-id or device by-path or loop device.
Loop device can be created using dd and losetup commands.
ex:
 dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/image1.img bs=4k count=800000
 losetup /dev/loop1 /home/image1.img
